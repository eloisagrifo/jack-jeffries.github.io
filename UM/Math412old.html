<h4><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jackjeff/412/412syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a></h4>

Dr. <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jackjeff/">Jack Jeffries</a> (please address me as &quot;Jack&quot;)<br><br>

Math 412  is an introduction to abstract algebra,
 required for all math majors but possibly of interest also to physicists, computer scientists, 
and lovers of mathematics. We
 will begin with ring theory: our first goal is to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, 
 about the ring you've been studying since elementary school, the integers. In the second half, 
we will study  group theory. In addition to developing many examples, 
students will prove nearly all statements in this course.<br>
Warning: we differ from the book by including in our definition of ring that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.0135.pdf">every ring contains 1</a>.

<br>

<h4>Sections:</h4>
 
 <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~kesmith/Math412-2017.html">Sections 1 and 2</a>: taught by Professor <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~kesmith/">Karen Smith</a>
<br>

 Section 3: 9-10 AM Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in Mason Hall 3330

<h4>Course Assistant:</h4> Yifan Wu
 
<br><br>

 All sections will use the same syllabus, do the same classwork, take the same  exams, and do the same homework, 
regardless of instructor.


 
<h4>Prerequisites:</h4> 
 Math 217. Students are expected to know linear algebra and to have had a course in which they have been trained in rigorous proof techniques (induction, proof by contradiction, etc).

<h4>Course Description:</h4> This class is an introduction to the basic concepts of algebra. 
The topics covered are approximately Chapters 1-9 and 13 in the textbook. The class
is roughly structured as follows:  we begin with a rigorous study of arithmetic of the integers 
 (division algorithm, primes, and unique factorization, congruences, modular arithmetic) culminating with the proof of the
 Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Part II is about basic properties of rings and
ring homomorphism (ideals, quotient rings, fields). Here, another 
 important example, which shares many properties of <b>Z</b>, the integers, is the ring of polynomials over a field. 
Finally,  in  part  III  we  study  the  basics  of  group  theory 
 (groups, group homomorphisms,  symmetry groups, the symmetric group, 
normal subgroups, quotient groups, and group actions on sets).
 The parts are not evenly spaced: I is shorter than II, and II is shorter than III.

<h4>Daily Update:</h4>
Wednesday 11/29: Started with a quiz, then did A-C(2) of worksheet #22.
 Will finish that, then go on to simple groups and structure of finite abelian groups next time.<br>
Monday 11/27: We finished
 finding the normal subgroups and the quotient groups of the symmetric groups on 4 and 5 elements, front side of worksheet #21.
 Next time, we will start with the quiz, then go 
on to the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, and simple groups.
 Please read the Diffie-Hellman part of the RSA worksheet / Thanksgiving leftovers worksheet before next week.<br> 
Wednesday 11/22: We discussed RSA today,
 following the RSA worksheet #20 below. We didn't get to Diffie-Hellman. Will resume with normal subgroups after the break.<br>
Wednesday 11/14, Friday 11/16: Discussed normal subgroups and quotient groups, worksheet #19.
Monday 11/12: Started with a quiz.
 Discussed the bonus problem on testing whether an element is a cyclic generator for the multiplicative group of Z/p.

Review sections 8.2 and 8.3, as well as problem D from HW#7 for next time. A summary of what we covered on group actions is posted below.<br>
Friday 11/9: Finished the worksheet on group actions. Discussed the Orbit-Stabilizer theorem and examples. Read 8.3 for Monday.<br>
Wednesday 11/7: Discussed the fact that even though we know multiplicative groups of finite fields are cyclic, what generates them is subtle.
Started on the group actions worksheet. Review 8.1 and 8.2 for next time.<br> 
Monday 11/5: We reviewed the proof of the theorem that the multiplicative group of any finite field is cyclic. We then defined a group action on a set, and disucssed the example of the integers acting on the real number line. Review the definitions on today's worksheet for next time.<br>

Monday 10/23: Collected some 
examples of groups: 
additive groups of rings, multiplicative groups of units, and
groups of symmetries/permutations. Did worksheet #13 on Groups 2.

element divides the order of the group. Read 7.3 for next time.
 There is a quiz on Wedensday.<br> 
Friday 10/20: Did worksheet #12 on Groups. Read 7.1 and 7.2 for next time. No quiz on Monday.<br>
Wednesday 10/18: Reviewed what elements are units in quotients of polynomial rings, and how to solve linear equations there.

<h4>Course Expectations:</h4> 

Math 412  students are responsible for learning the material on their own through individual reading of 
the textbook <b> before</b> coming to class. Like in Math 217, you will often work together on 
 more theoretical concepts in small groups using worksheets in class.
 You will be expected to work out more computational exercises on your own,
which will be supplemented with some webwork when possible.
 You will also have a graded, written problem set (think Math 217 Part B) due Fridays. <b>Attendance is required</b>.  
 
 There will be two exams (one midterm and a final).
 There will be many quizzes, some on the reading.
 




<h4>Exams:</h4>

<h4>Testing and Disability:</h4> If you think you need an accommodation for a disability, please let me know as soon as 
possible.  In particular, a Verified Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) 
form must be provided to me at least two weeks
prior to the need for a test/quiz accommodation. 
The <a href="http://ssd.umich.edu/
